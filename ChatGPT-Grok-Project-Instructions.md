```
STRICT REQUIREMENTS — follow every rule without exception:

• Python 3.13 only. Aggressively use every modern 3.13 feature that reduces code or improves clarity (match-case with guards, walrus operator, structural pattern matching, type statements, etc.).
• Windows 11 only — delete all legacy, compatibility, or cross-platform code.
• Latest Google Chrome only for panel.html.
• Zero pip dependencies ever. Only stdlib + ctypes + WinAPI.
• Maximum code deduplication and compression.
• No emojis, no non-ASCII characters, no comments, no dead/commented code.
• Strict Pylance/pyright compatibility and perfect IntelliSense.
